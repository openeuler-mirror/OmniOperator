## Installation Overview<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0000002515782482"></a>

### Network Planning<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0000002515782488"></a>

A storage-compute coupled networking architecture is recommended for the subfeatures. Storage nodes and compute nodes are shared to maximize the computing acceleration effect in big data scenarios.

The coupled storage and compute network of OmniOperator consists of four servers, which are one management node and three compute nodes. In the following, we will be using HDFS on the storage nodes for illustration:

- The management node is server1, which is used to manage tasks.
- The compute nodes are agent1, agent2, and agent3, which are used to run OmniOperator.

A server can function as a management node and a compute node at the same time. In single-node mode, operations performed on the management node or compute node mentioned in the following sections are performed on the same node.  [Figure 1](#fig734218245342)  shows the networking diagram.

## Installing the Feature<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0000002515782478"></a>

### Installation Node Requirements<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0000002515782464"></a>

This section describes the requirements for installing dependency packages and configuring environment variables on each node before installing OmniOperator.

- If you choose to perform the installation by compiling the source code, before compiling the source code, install GCC/G++, Autoconf, and CMake on each node.  [Table 1](#en-us_topic_0000001519205289_table98249491204)  lists the version requirements.

    >![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:** 
    >-   LLVM and Jemalloc can run properly only after being compiled on the OS. If you want to run them on CentOS, compile them on CentOS. If you want to run them on openEuler 20.03 LTS SP1 or openEuler 22.03 LTS SP1, compile them on openEuler 20.03 LTS SP1 or openEuler 22.03 LTS SP1.
    >-   Gluten depends on the ABSL library and can run properly only after it is compiled and installed on the current OS \(openEuler 22.03 SP1\).

    **Table  1**  Software required for source code compilation

|Software Name|Version Requirement|Download URL|

|GCC/G++|openEuler 22.03: 10.3.0|Link|
|Autoconf|2.69|Link|
|CMake|3.20.5|Link|


    1. Install GCC/G++. The following uses version 7.3.0 as an example.
        1. Check whether the GCC/G++ version is the target version.

            ```
            gcc --version
            g++ --version
            ```

        2. Compile and install GCC/G++.

            ```
            # Extract the installation package and go to the gcc-7.3.0 directory.
            tar -zxvf gcc-7.3.0.tar.gz
            cd gcc-7.3.0
            # Perform compilation and installation.
            mkdir build && cd build
            ../configure --prefix=/usr/local/gcc-7.3.0 --enable-languages=c,c++ --disable-multilib 
            make -j$(nproc)
            make install
            # Set environment variables.
            echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/gcc-7.3.0/bin:$PATH' >> /etc/profile
            echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/gcc-7.3.0/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> /etc/profile
            source /etc/profile
            # Verify the Installation.
            gcc --version
            g++ --version
            ```

    2. Compile and install Autoconf.
        1. Check whether the Autoconf version is the target version.

            ```
            autoconf --version
            ```

        2. Compile and install Autoconf.

            ```
            # Extract the installation package and go to the autoconf-2.69 directory.
            tar -zxvf autoconf-2.69.tar.gz
            cd autoconf-2.69
            # Perform compilation and installation.
            ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/autoconf-2.69
            make -j$(nproc)
            make install
            # Set environment variables.
            echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/autoconf-2.69/bin:$PATH' >> /etc/profile
            source /etc/profile
            # Verify the Installation.
            autoconf --version
            ```

    3. Install CMake.
        1. Check whether the CMake version is the target version.

            ```
            cmake --version
            ```

        2. Install CMake.

            ```
            # Extract the installation package to any directory (/opt in this example).
            tar -zxvf cmake-3.20.5-linux-aarch64.tar.gz -C /opt
            # Set environment variables.
            echo 'export PATH=/opt/cmake-3.20.5-linux-aarch64/bin:$PATH' >> /etc/profile
            source /etc/profile
            # Verify the Installation.
            cmake --version
            ```

- Before installing OmniOperator, deploy necessary components in the cluster environment by following instructions in  [OS and Software Requirements](environment-requirements.md#section112321019581).
- Before configuring environment variables, check whether the environment variable  **LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH**  exists in your environment. If the environment variable does not exist, you do not need to add  **$LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH**  during configuration, so as to prevent irrelevant content from being introduced to the current path. Otherwise, security problems may occur. All environment variable export operations in this document comply with this principle. Take  **LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH**  as an example. If  **LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH**  already exists in your environment, use  **export LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=_$LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH:/xxx_**. Otherwise, use  **export LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=_/xxx_**.

This section describes the requirements for installing dependency packages and configuring environment variables on each node before installing OmniOperator.
### Installing Dependencies<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0000002515782474"></a>

When installing OmniOperator locally, install the LLVM and jemalloc dependency packages on the management node to combine OmniOperator and Spark.

In the Spark on Yarn scenario, use the  **--archives**  parameter of Spark to simplify the deployment. You can install the dependencies either by downloading precompiled SO files or by compiling source code. The precompiled SO file can be downloaded and installed quickly, and is suitable for most scenarios. In contrast, compiling and installing from source code is slower, but may be required for certain compliance scenarios.

**Installing Dependencies \(By Downloading Precompiled SO Files for SparkExtension\)<a name="section54515015398"></a>**

**Installing LLVM and jemalloc**

>![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:** 
>-   Select the dependency package based on your OS type. The following uses openEuler 22.03 as an example and the dependency package is  **Dependency\_library\_openeuler22.03.zip**.
>-   The  **/opt/omni-operator**  and  **/opt/omni-operator/lib**  directories can be customized.

1. Create an  **/opt/omni-operator/**  directory on the management node as the root directory for installing OmniOperator. Then go to the directory.

    ```
    mkdir /opt/omni-operator
    cd /opt/omni-operator
    -
    ```

2. Upload the  **Dependency\_library\_openeuler22.03.zip**  package obtained from  [Obtaining Software Packages](environment-requirements.md#section189181357102011)  to the  **/opt/omni-operator/**  directory and extract it.

    ```
    unzip Dependency_library_openeuler22.03.zip
    ```

3. Create an  **/opt/omni-operator/lib**  directory, and copy the  **libLLVM-15.so**  and  **libjemalloc.so.2**  subpackages in  **Dependency\_library\_openeuler**  to the  **/opt/omni-operator/lib**  directory.

    >![](public_sys-resources/icon-notice.gif) **NOTICE:** 
    >If LLVM and jemalloc have been installed in the environment, delete the existing  **libLLVM-15.so**  and  **libjemalloc.so.2**  files before running the copy command.
    >```
    >rm -rf /opt/omni-operator/lib/libjemalloc.so.2
    >rm -rf /opt/omni-operator/lib/libLLVM-15.so
    >```

### Installing OmniOperator<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0000002515622558"></a>

Install OmniOperator on the management and compute nodes and set environment variables. If OmniOperator is enabled for Gluten, skip this section.

>![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:** 
>-   **BoostKit-omniop\_2.0.0.zip**  can be obtained by extracting  **BoostKit-omniruntime\_2.0.0.zip**. The  **BoostKit-omniop\_2.0.0.zip**  package contains the  **boostkit-omniop-operator-2.0.0-aarch64-openeuler.tar.gz**  and  **boostkit-omniop-operator-2.0.0-aarch64-centos.tar.gz**  packages, which are used for openEuler and CentOS, respectively. The following uses openEuler as an example.
>-   To install OmniOperator on CentOS, replace  **boostkit-omniop-operator-2.0.0-aarch64-openeuler.tar.gz**  in the following commands with  **boostkit-omniop-operator-2.0.0-aarch64-centos.tar.gz**.

1. Upload OmniOperator packages obtained in  [Obtaining Software Packages](environment-requirements.md#section189181357102011)  to the  **/opt/omni-operator/**  directory on the management and compute nodes.
2. Go to the  **/opt/omni-operator/**  directory and extract the packages.

    ```
    cd /opt/omni-operator/
    unzip BoostKit-omniruntime_1.9.0.zip
    unzip BoostKit-omniop_2.0.0.zip
    tar -zxvf boostkit-omniop-operator-2.0.0-aarch64-openeuler.tar.gz
    ```

3. Copy OmniOperator files to the  **/opt/omni-operator/lib**  directory and set the permission on the software packages in the directory to  **550**.

    ```
    cd /opt/omni-operator/boostkit-omniop-operator-2.0.0-aarch64
    cp -r include libboostkit* boostkit-omniop* libsecurec.so /opt/omni-operator/lib/

    cd /opt
    mv omni-operator-bak omni-operator
    ```

Install OmniOperator on the management and compute nodes and set environment variables. If OmniOperator is enabled for Gluten, skip this section.
### \(Optional\) Installing the UDF Plugin<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0000002515622536"></a>

You need to perform the operations described in this section only when your service scenario involves user-defined functions \(UDFs\). Perform the following plugin operation operations only on the management node. UDFs cannot be accelerated when OmniOperator is enabled for Gluten.

This plugin supports only the HiveSimpleUDF type \(simple UDFs written based on the Hive UDF framework\). HiveSimpleUDF is built on the Hive UDF framework and is used to extend the set of functions available in Hive queries. Spark supports Hive UDF interfaces. Therefore, HiveSimpleUDF can be directly used in a Spark environment.

OmniOperator accelerates UDFs through row-by-row or batch processing. You can switch between these two processing modes by modifying the configuration file.

**Prerequisites<a name="section15136154016211"></a>**

- Ensure that your UDFs are simple UDFs implemented based on the Hive UDF framework.
- To use OmniOperator to accelerate UDFs, you need to provide related JAR packages and configuration files, including the following files:
- **udf.zip**: contains the class files of all UDFs.
- **conf.zip**: contains the configuration files on which the UDFs depend.
- **udf.properties**: used to configure OmniOperator to accelerate UDFs.

    Using  **udfName1**  and  **udfName2**  as examples, the  **udf.properties**  file has the following format:

1. Create an  **/opt/omni-operator/hive-udf**  directory on the management node.

    ```
    mkdir /opt/omni-operator/hive-udf
    ```

2. Upload the  **udf.zip**  and  **conf.zip**  packages to the  **/opt/omni-operator/hive-udf**  directory on the management node.

    >![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:** 
    >You can customize the example names of the  **udf.zip**  and  **conf.zip**  packages based on your service requirements.

3. Extract the files.

    ```
    cd /opt/omni-operator/hive-udf
    unzip udf.zip
    rm -f udf.zip
    unzip conf.zip
    rm -f conf.zip
    ```

4. Modify the  **/opt/omni-operator/conf/omni.conf**  file.
    1. Open the configuration file.

        ```
        vi /opt/omni-operator/conf/omni.conf
        ```

    2. Press  **i**  to enter the insert mode and add the following UDF configuration.

        ```
        # <----UDF properties---->
        # false indicates expression row-by-row processing and true indicates expression bath processing.
        enableBatchExprEvaluate=false
        # UDF trustlist file path
        hiveUdfPropertyFilePath=./hive-udf/udf.properties
        # Directory of the Hive UDF JAR package
        hiveUdfDir=./hive-udf/udf
        ```

        >![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:** 
        >The directory must start with a period \(.\). When OmniOperator is running, it reads the value of the  **OMNI\_HOME**  environment variable and uses this value to replace the period \(.\).

    3. Press  **Esc**, type  **:wq!**, and press  **Enter**  to save the file and exit.

5. Update the environment variable.
    1. Open the  **\~/.bashrc**  file.

        ```
        vi ~/.bashrc
        ```

    2. Press  **i**  to enter the insert mode and add  **LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH**  to update environment variables.

        ```
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:${JAVA_HOME}/jre/lib/aarch64/server
        ```

    3. Press  **Esc**, type  **:wq!**, and press  **Enter**  to save the file and exit.
    4. Make the updated environment variable take effect.

        ```
        source ~/.bashrc
        ```

**Installing the UDF Plugin Batch Processing<a name="section518339172217"></a>**

After installing row-by-row processing on the management node, modify the  **/opt/omni-operator/conf/omni.conf**  file to support batch processing.

1. Open the file.

    ```
    vi /opt/omni-operator/conf/omni.conf
    ```

2. Press  **i**  to enter the insert mode, find the following statements, and modify them.

    ```
    enableBatchExprEvaluate=true
    ```

3. Press  **Esc**, type  **:wq!**, and press  **Enter**  to save the file and exit.

You need to perform the operations described in this section only when your service scenario involves user-defined functions \(UDFs\). Perform the following plugin operation operations only on the management node. UDFs cannot be accelerated when OmniOperator is enabled for Gluten.
